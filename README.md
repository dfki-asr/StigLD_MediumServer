# StigLD_MediumServer

Implementation of the medium server for the MTO scenario in the BIC-TA paper. This server is used to inject evolution queries (like diffusion, decay etc) to the Fuseki server before any agent queries are responded to. This is to ensure that the agent queries operate on the most up-to-date model of the environment
